# Prisma Migrations

This directory contains the database schema migrations generated by Prisma.

**Do not edit these files manually.**

To create a new migration, run:
`npx prisma migrate dev --name your-migration-name`

To apply migrations to a production database, run:
`npx prisma migrate deploy`

An initial migration directory structure has been created. You should run `prisma migrate dev` to generate your first real migration based on the `schema.prisma` file.
